# projecteuler.net_python
A brief collection of my solutions for the challenges on projecteuler.net  
The solutions may by far not be perfect but maybe it's a help for someone who's absolutely stuck with a challenge. I firstly did the scripts for myself so the most of the comments are still in german, but this will be changed soon and til then you can use google translate or just ask me if anything is unclear.  
  
I've run the code in jupyter notebook and if there's more than one cell to run, I've separated them with a line of hashes.
